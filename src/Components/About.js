              As a Junior Full-Stack Developer, I am excited to embark on my
              journey in the world of web development.I have acquired a strong
              foundation in front-end and back-end development. I am proficient
              in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building responsive and
              user-friendly interfaces. I also have experience with React.js,
              which allows me to create dynamic and interactive web
              applications. On the server side, I have worked extensively with
              Node.js and Express.js to develop robust APIs and handle data
              manipulation. I am comfortable working with NoSQL databases like
              MongoDB to store and retrieve data efficiently. Additionally, I
              have knowledge of RESTful principles and understand the importance
              of clean code and scalability.
